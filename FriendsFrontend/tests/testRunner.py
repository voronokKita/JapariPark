Runs the specified tests.

My attempt to build flexible testing system that wraps around pytest.

Testing pyramid:
          6. Manual E2E test - with production environment   .\
        5. Manual tests - with test-settings and debuggers     .\
      4. Specific tests - like Docker environment and other misc .\
    3. Function tests (integration) - the ability of               .\
       the system to process requests and do certain tasks          .
  2. Serving tests - communications and accessibility                .\
1. Unit tests - atomised functions                                     .\
